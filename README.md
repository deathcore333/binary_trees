Binary Tree

Welcome to my repository exploring the topic of C-binary trees! Here, you will find information on data structures, tree traversal, binary search trees, and more.

Binary Tree
A binary tree is a data structure that consists of nodes, each of which has at most two children, left and right. These children are themselves binary trees or null pointers. The root of the tree is the node that has no parent, and the leaves are the nodes that have no children.

Tree Traversal
Tree traversal refers to the process of visiting each node in a tree exactly once. There are several ways to traverse a binary tree, including:

Inorder traversal: Visit the left subtree, then the root, then the right subtree.
Preorder traversal: Visit the root, then the left subtree, then the right subtree.
Postorder traversal: Visit the left subtree, then the right subtree, then the root.
Binary Search Tree
A binary search tree is a binary tree that satisfies the binary search property. This property states that, for each node in the tree, all nodes in the left subtree are less than the node, and all nodes in the right subtree are greater than the node.

Data structures: Binary Tree
In C, binary trees can be implemented using structures and pointers. Here is an example:

c
Copy code
typedef struct node {
    int data;
    struct node* left;
    struct node* right;
} Node;

Node* create_node(int data) {
    Node* new_node = (Node*) malloc(sizeof(Node));
    new_node->data = data;
    new_node->left = NULL;
    new_node->right = NULL;
    return new_node;
}
This creates a Node structure with an integer data field and pointers to the left and right children. The create_node function initializes a new node with the given data and null pointers for the children.

I hope you find this repository helpful in your studies of C-binary trees. Happy coding!
